CoServ Electric Cooperative,"As an electric cooperative, every decision we make is driven by our responsibility to you, our Member. Our priority is to ensure that we deliver safe and reliable service to you through well maintained and managed infrastructure, keeping rates as low as possible for our Members, and maintaining transparency throughout our business. Part of how we manage this is through continual improvement by periodically reviewing our policies, rates, and tariff. After careful consideration and review by your board of directors, the following changes will be effective as of November 1, 2024.The Membership Fee will decrease from $15 to $0. The Connect Fee will increase from $25 to $40.Seasonal changes to the energy charge will be replaced with a fixed, year-round rate for the energy charge* following standard rates: Residential, Residential with Distributed Generation, Commercial, and Public Buildings (under 35 kW).The changes outlined above will allow us to serve you better. Below is an explanation for each change. Membership Fee: By reducing the Membership Fee to $0, we can reduce the additional upfront expense of becoming a Member of CoServ while still ensuring that our Members have ownership in the co-op and the benefits that come with it. For current Members with a Membership Fee on file, the Membership Fee will be refunded when their account(s) is closed.Connect FeeWe are increasing the Connect Fee from $25 to $40, which is in line with or cheaper than most other utilities in Texas.Every request to connect new service is a multi-level effort from customer service, billing, operations, and many other departments to fulfill each request promptly and efficiently. We have not increased our Connect Fee since 2001. Because keeping rates as low as possible for the entire Membership is a top priority for us, increasing the Connect Fee was necessary due to increased operating costs over the years.  We will be removing the seasonality from rates for those on our standard Residential (including Members with Distributed Generation), Commercial, and Public Buildings (under 35 kW) rates to make it easier to understand how you are being billed.",1-Nov-24,Cost,"Cost, quality",Residential and Commercial Electric Utility Service,22 - Utilities,221122 - Electric Power Distribution,Yes,320.8828355151515,343

OCM Inc.,"Dear Valued Customers, On Saturday, February 1st, the Trump Administration officially confirmed the immediate implementation of a 10% tariff on all products imported from China. Unlike historical price increases that result from rising material and operational costs over time, this tariff is an immediate tax of 10% that is already in effect as of the date of this letter. As a result of this action, OCM must pass along the true impact of this tariff to our customers with a 9% increase on all imported products effective Tuesday, February 4th, 2025. After a total cost review, the 9% increase is in recognition that the tariff does not apply to the freight expense within each container; rather, the tariff only applies to the value of the products inside. Please note that back in September of 2018 President Trump implemented a similar 10% tariff on China and then quickly followed it up with an additional 15% in January 2019 for a total of 25%. This same possibility exists now 6 years later. On a related note, OCM has recently received the first of an anticipated number of price increases on domestic wire rod from Nucor Steel under the protection of these same tariffs. Leon J. Topalian, the CEO of Nucor Corp, wrote on Friday, “We look forward to working with President Trump to enforce our trade laws and strengthen American manufacturing!” Below is the link of the Fox News article with additional commentary from Topalian. Clearly, Nucor Steel intends to avail itself of industry protection provided by the tariffs to increase the price of wire rod and other steel products. Armed with the knowledge of additional increases coming in the very near term, OCM is announcing a price increase on all domestic metal bar supports effective Monday, April 7th. Currently we are targeting a 10% price increase but the end result could be more. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/america-first-largest-steel-producer-us-announces-support-trump-tariffs. In addition, OCM will be reviewing our complete customer freight policy to make necessary adjustments to keep in step with rising product and freight costs. LTL freight companies have begun a process of executing general rate increases to start 2025 and that trend is expected to continue. We will work hard to minimize the impact of rising freight costs on our customers and will follow up with more communication in the coming weeks. Although we all anticipated increases to begin in 2025, these events still present various challenges to managing our collective businesses. Please be assured that OCM will work closely with our customers to provide all of you with the necessary level of communication and support to help all of us navigate what we hope will be a very prosperous 2025.

We have diligently addressed these challenges, and your order is now scheduled for shipment within the coming weeks.New Import Tariffs Between Germany and the USEffective April 9, 2025, the United States government introduced a 20% import tariff on all goods imported from Germany. Unfortunately, this measure was announced without prior notice, leaving no time for companies like ours to prepare or respond appropriately. We were caught off guard by the sudden implementation and are now forced to react immediately.I know this news may be disappointing, and it is not easy for me to ask this of you. Still, to proceed with your delivery, we kindly ask that you cover this newly imposed US Import Tariff of 20% based on your original purchase price.We fully understand that this may come as an unexpected and frustrating financial burden, and we are truly sorry to ask for your support in this situation. Please know that this is not a step we take lightly. We have already taken on significant additional costs ourselves.Initially, we charged only $110 USD for shipping, assuming Walkolution II could be safely shipped via standard parcel services. However, this method resulted in significant damage during international transit. To ensure your product's safe arrival, we now exclusively ship on pallets via air freight, incurring actual costs exceeding $600 USD per shipment.

Still, at Philo, we haven't raised our prices since we launched more thanAs many of you know, our contracts with our content partners include fees we pay that go up every year, and a significant part of the cost of Philo is driven by our platform and billing partners.

Ames Lake Water Assoc.,"Dear ALWA Member,Over the past 10 years, we have upgraded and modernized the water system, by replacing key components of thecritical infrastructure, resulting in increased efficiency, reliability, and security. Most importantly, we have been able to make these capital improvements with only two minor increases in our water rates over that 10-year period. But now we are about to tackle our largest infrastructure project in ALWA history, which is replacing the watermain around Ames Lake. This massive project is part of our 10-year water system plan, which has been approved by the Washington State Department of Health. Because of the sheer size of this project, we will need to raise water rates and add a CIP (Capital Improvement Plan) charge to everyone's monthly bill. These new charges are effective starting with your May 2024 water bill. What we are doing: over the next 8-10 years we will be gradually replacing the water main around the lake. Even if you don't live anywhere close to Ames Lake itself, your water supply is dependent on this infrastructure as we use the watermains around the lake to distribute water to every other part of our water system. The water main replacement will be done in stages, so only one part of the road around the lake will be under construction at any one time. Plenty of notice will be given before construction starts. How your bill will be impacted: there are two ways you will see your bill change with the new water rates: a Capital Improvement Charge (labeled as CIP on your bill) of $11 will be added to every monthly bill. The amount you are paying for water will also go up, with every tier seeing a 5% increase to the existingrate, plus an additional charge of 10 cents per 100 gallons of water.Examples of how your bill will increaseTo give you a better idea of how these new charges will impact your bill, we have put together a few examples foryou:‚ If your bill is normally $40 per month (19% of our customers)o Your new monthly bill will be $53 per month. If your bill is normally $55 per month (43% of our customers) Your new monthly bill will be $72 per month. If your bill is normally $70 per month (18 % of our customers)o Your new monthly bill will be $90 per month.These increases are taking place effective April 1, 2024. So, your next bill will reflect the updated charges.",1-Apr-24,Quality,Quality,Water Service,22 - Utilities,221310 - Water Supply and Irrigation Systems,No,335.9937979586564,412
Austin Energy,"We are writing to inform you of an upcoming change in the Plug-In EVerywhereSM Level 2 subscription pilot program effective June 30th. On that date, the subscription renewal period will end. You will not receive any further charges for subscription renewal. You will not have to call or submit a cancellation request form because we are actively working on canceling all subscribers by June 30, 2024. Starting June 30, 2024, the new pricing plan will be as follows:Level 2 Charging Stations will charge $0.09 per kWh, which comes out to ""about"" a penny_per minute_(previously $25 six- month subscription). DC Fast Charging will remain accessible to all at $0.21 per minute.

Telstra,"Long story short, If you've only got a minute, here's what you really need to know: We're increasing most of our prices for postpaid (hand-held) and pre-paid plans for a number of reasons including to help us keep investing in the performance, reliability and security of Australia's largest mobile network. Here's what it takes to keep it running. Increases on average are between $2 and $4 per month for most plans.Prices aren't changing straight away: postpaid prices change on 27 August 2024 and pre-paid prices change on 22 October 2024. We'll be in touch over the coming weeks to give you the details on how your pricing is changing. We have support available for those who need help.Read more below to find out what is changing, when and why. What's changing?In the coming weeks, we'll be changing the prices of our mobile postpaid and pre-paid plans, as well as pre-paid mobile broadband services.The price for most plans will increase between $2 and $4 a month. Prices won't be changing straight away, however. These changes will take effect from 27 August 2024 for postpaid customers and 22 October 2024 for our pre-paid customers. Why are we changing some of our prices? In May 2024, we let our postpaid mobile customers know that we were moving away from our CPI-linked annual pricing review.This change simplified our pricing approach to be more consistent across our products and services, and also reflected there are a range of factors that go into any pricing decision. It takes a lot of work and cost to run a mobile network as large as ours, and even more to support the increased usage we have seen on our network. The investments we make in our mobile network don't just help to keep your phone connected to your favourite content and apps. We know those are important, but our network does so much more every single day.Our connectivity is at the heart of the way Australia works and lives, supporting everything from major transport networks that get you from A to B, through to payment services for major banks and retailers, and even critical infrastructure that helps keep us safe everyday.These price changes help us to keep investing in mobile coverage, performance and local support, as well as ongoing investments to improve the security of our services.  We monitor our network 24/7 to help protect against scams by blocking malicious calls and texts from reaching you.Changing our prices is always a difficult decision, especially in the current climate. But if you look at the broader context around pricing, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that telecommunications pricing, which covers all telecommunications equipment and services beyond just mobile price, have not increased for consumers anywhere near the rate of other consumer household goods and services over the last decade. In fact, according to this data in eight of the last 10 years, those prices have actually deflated.Check out the graph below, based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which shows a comparison between how pricing has changed for other goods and services compared to telecommunications equipment and services.",22-Oct-24,Quality,Quality,Mobile Postpaid and Prepaid Plans,51 - Information,517311 - Wired Telecommunications Carriers,Yes,330.3095490909091,522
