Ames Lake Water Assoc.,Water Service,"Dear ALWA Member,Over the past 10 years, we have upgraded and modernized the water system, by replacing key components of thecritical infrastructure, resulting in increased efficiency, reliability, and security. Most importantly, we have been able to make these capital improvements with only two minor increases in our water rates over that 10-year period. But now we are about to tackle our largest infrastructure project in ALWA history, which is replacing the watermain around Ames Lake. This massive project is part of our 10-year water system plan, which has been approved by the Washington State Department of Health. Because of the sheer size of this project, we will need to raise water rates and add a CIP (Capital Improvement Plan) charge to everyone's monthly bill. These new charges are effective starting with your May 2024 water bill. What we are doing: over the next 8-10 years we will be gradually replacing the water main around the lake. Even if you don't live anywhere close to Ames Lake itself, your water supply is dependent on this infrastructure as we use the watermains around the lake to distribute water to every other part of our water system. The water main replacement will be done in stages, so only one part of the road around the lake will be under construction at any one time. Plenty of notice will be given before construction starts. How your bill will be impacted: there are two ways you will see your bill change with the new water rates: a Capital Improvement Charge (labeled as CIP on your bill) of $11 will be added to every monthly bill. The amount you are paying for water will also go up, with every tier seeing a 5% increase to the existingrate, plus an additional charge of 10 cents per 100 gallons of water.Examples of how your bill will increaseTo give you a better idea of how these new charges will impact your bill, we have put together a few examples foryou:‚ If your bill is normally $40 per month (19% of our customers)o Your new monthly bill will be $53 per month. If your bill is normally $55 per month (43% of our customers) Your new monthly bill will be $72 per month. If your bill is normally $70 per month (18 % of our customers)o Your new monthly bill will be $90 per month.These increases are taking place effective April 1, 2024. So, your next bill will reflect the updated charges.",22 – Utilities,221310 – Water Supply and Irrigation Systems,1-Apr-24,Quality,Quality,Yes,335.9937979586564,412

Bostik,Construction & Consumer Adhesive Products,"Even though supply chain conditions have improved lately, a few challenges remain in particular because price of raw materials reached a new level and are not expected to decrease materially any time soon. Furthermore, several of the impacts affecting the industry have become permanent such as energy and labor costs. On top of that, some cost segments are continuing to increase for specific reasons: Cements and aggregates costs did increase further in 2023 and we expect another hike in 2024 due to costs associated to CO2 emissions mitigation and energy. Packaging costs are stable or on the rise (depending on the family), in an industry with limited available capacity. Labor costs continue to be very high, with inflation resistant to decrease in Europe, US and Asia. Inflation is expected to be back to the 2% range target of Central Banks only in 2025/26. Freight, after a few months of stability, are starting to increase again linked to petrol prices and labor shortage.Compliance and regulatory costs which continue to increase year after year.Over the last few months, Bostik has done great efforts to absorb such raw materials cost increases, holding its pricing conditions while maintaining Bostik renown level of product quality.However, and despite our best efforts to postpone such decision, we are reviewing our prices upwards to protect our sustainability as your business partner. We are hereby informing you that starting from January 1st, 2024, Bostik Construction & Consumer products prices will increase by approximately 5% depending on the region/country and product family.

OCM Inc.,Concrete Construction Accessories (Imported Products & Domestic Metal Bar Supports),"Dear Valued Customers, On Saturday, February 1st, the Trump Administration officially confirmed the immediate implementation of a 10% tariff on all products imported from China. Unlike historical price increases that result from rising material and operational costs over time, this tariff is an immediate tax of 10% that is already in effect as of the date of this letter. As a result of this action, OCM must pass along the true impact of this tariff to our customers with a 9% increase on all imported products effective Tuesday, February 4th, 2025. After a total cost review, the 9% increase is in recognition that the tariff does not apply to the freight expense within each container; rather, the tariff only applies to the value of the products inside. Please note that back in September of 2018 President Trump implemented a similar 10% tariff on China and then quickly followed it up with an additional 15% in January 2019 for a total of 25%. This same possibility exists now 6 years later. On a related note, OCM has recently received the first of an anticipated number of price increases on domestic wire rod from Nucor Steel under the protection of these same tariffs. Leon J. Topalian, the CEO of Nucor Corp, wrote on Friday, “We look forward to working with President Trump to enforce our trade laws and strengthen American manufacturing!” Below is the link of the Fox News article with additional commentary from Topalian. Clearly, Nucor Steel intends to avail itself of industry protection provided by the tariffs to increase the price of wire rod and other steel products. Armed with the knowledge of additional increases coming in the very near term, OCM is announcing a price increase on all domestic metal bar supports effective Monday, April 7th. Currently we are targeting a 10% price increase but the end result could be more. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/america-first-largest-steel-producer-us-announces-support-trump-tariffs. In addition, OCM will be reviewing our complete customer freight policy to make necessary adjustments to keep in step with rising product and freight costs. LTL freight companies have begun a process of executing general rate increases to start 2025 and that trend is expected to continue. We will work hard to minimize the impact of rising freight costs on our customers and will follow up with more communication in the coming weeks. Although we all anticipated increases to begin in 2025, these events still present various challenges to managing our collective businesses. Please be assured that OCM will work closely with our customers to provide all of you with the necessary level of communication and support to help all of us navigate what we hope will be a very prosperous 2025.

Here's what it takes to keep it running. Increases on average are between $2 and $4 per month for most plans.Prices aren't changing straight away: postpaid prices change on 27 August 2024 and pre-paid prices change on 22 October 2024. We'll be in touch over the coming weeks to give you the details on how your pricing is changing. We have support available for those who need help.Read more below to find out what is changing, when and why. What's changing?In the coming weeks, we'll be changing the prices of our mobile postpaid and pre-paid plans, as well as pre-paid mobile broadband services.The price for most plans will increase between $2 and $4 a month. Prices won't be changing straight away, however. These changes will take effect from 27 August 2024 for postpaid customers and 22 October 2024 for our pre-paid customers. Why are we changing some of our prices? In May 2024, we let our postpaid mobile customers know that we were moving away from our CPI-linked annual pricing review.This change simplified our pricing approach to be more consistent across our products and services, and also reflected there are a range of factors that go into any pricing decision. It takes a lot of work and cost to run a mobile network as large as ours, and even more to support the increased usage we have seen on our network. The investments we make in our mobile network don't just help to keep your phone connected to your favourite content and apps. We know those are important, but our network does so much more every single day.Our connectivity is at the heart of the way Australia works and lives, supporting everything from major transport networks that get you from A to B, through to payment services for major banks and retailers, and even critical infrastructure that helps keep us safe everyday.These price changes help us to keep investing in mobile coverage, performance and local support, as well as ongoing investments to improve the security of our services.  We monitor our network 24/7 to help protect against scams by blocking malicious calls and texts from reaching you.Changing our prices is always a difficult decision, especially in the current climate. But if you look at the broader context around pricing, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that telecommunications pricing, which covers all telecommunications equipment and services beyond just mobile price, have not increased for consumers anywhere near the rate of other consumer household goods and services over the last decade. In fact, according to this data in eight of the last 10 years, those prices have actually deflated.Check out the graph below, based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which shows a comparison between how pricing has changed for other goods and services compared to telecommunications equipment and services.",51 – Information,517311 – Wired Telecommunications Carriers,22-Oct-24,Quality,Quality,Yes,330.3095490909091,522

We can reflect with pride on the many accomplishments achieved that were made possible by our engaged members, active volunteers, loyal donors, supportive families, and dedicated staff. From exercise to education, from aerobics to advocacy, from fitness to financial assistance, the Y doesn't just strengthen our bodies, it strengthens our minds and our communities. The Y is so much more than a gym. It's a cause - a cause dedicated to youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. Although we remain fiscally prudent and resourceful with our operations, we continue to be challenged by various external environmental factors, such as annual increases in minimum wage (50% increase since 2010 as mandated by the State of New Jersey), utility costs, and general supplies necessary to maintain the daily operation of our facility. Since 2012, the Greater Morristown YMCA has been extremely fortunate to maintain our membership fees without any increases. However, after careful consideration, we have decided to implement a modest increase in membership fees beginning June 3, 2024. We have a history of being very sensitive regarding the affordability of our YMCA memberships, and even with our modest increase, we continue to offer some of the lowest membership rates in and around the surrounding area. These increases will allow us to remain a financially sound and sustainable non-profit organization, providing updated excellent facilities, innovative high-quality programs, and the latest and greatest equipment.","71 – Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation",713940 – Fitness and Recreational Sports Centers,3-May-24,Cost,"Cost, market, quality",Yes,313.52905493723847,253

Second, we're increasing the price of our all-access membership in North America after eight years without a price increase.

Our Members are also getting more out of their Membership: monthly workouts per All-Access Membership more than tripled from 4.4 in October-December 2014 to 15.5 in October-December 2021.

So, starting June 1, 2022, we will be increasing the price of our monthly North America All-Access membership fee from $39 to $44 in the US and from $49 to $55 in Canada.International membership pricing is currently unchanged, as we are continuing to build out our library of content for our global audience.The price of hardware relative to the subscription is one of many levers by which we are looking to reduce barriers to entry.Last month we launched a pilot program in select US markets, One Peloton Club, which enables Members to rent a Peloton Bike with zero commitment and access our complete library of live and on-demand fitness classes for one low monthly fee. We've expanded this test and added Bike+ so we can continue to gather data that will drive our decision making.We have an unwavering commitment to deliver the best connected-fitness experience anytime, anywhere.
